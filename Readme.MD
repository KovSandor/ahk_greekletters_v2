## Autohotkey for Greek Letters

This AHK script is a nice solution for the question ["Fastest way to type greek letters like α or β?"](https://superuser.com/q/936999/169199). After installing the script you simply activate <kbd>⇪ Capslock</kbd>, then you type for instance the key <kbd>a</kbd> which turns immediately into <kbd>α</kbd>. As fast as it can be. 

To get capitalized letters, activate <kbd>⇪ Capslock</kbd>, then hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> and press the letter you need.
